# CanadianCommonCV
Python script/notebook to manipulate publications in XML files exported from CCV.
When you start with your CCV, you try to import your pubs from a bib file just to realize that the import just does not work.
This notebook may help you to fix up all your entries quickly.
How does this work?
You export your CCV in XML format.
Put it next to the notebook.
From the notebook you will read it in, manipulate it, edit it, programmatically.
Then you can save the new XML which can be imported to the CCV system.
